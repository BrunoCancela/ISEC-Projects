# ISEC-Projects

This repository contains a selection of projects I developed during my Bachelor's degree. These were the ones I enjoyed the most working on, either because of the challenge they presented or the skills I was able to improve through them.

Feel free to explore the folders for each project. Each one includes its own documentation and context.
